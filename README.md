# one_instruction_cpu

turing complete cpu that can only implement one instruction, (SUBLEQ: subtract and jump if less than or equal to zero) in hardware

design is for an 8 stage cpu cycle with instructions and data all occupying the same memory space. 

this is a 16 bit cpu architecture allowing for 2's complement computation
